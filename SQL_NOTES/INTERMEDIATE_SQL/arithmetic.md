- SQL allows us to perform arithmetic operations like +,-,/,\*
- when you divide 4/3 it gives answer 1 because it assumes you want result as an integer as input is integer. So if you want precision use 4.0/3.0

## AGGREGATE VS ARITHMETIC

-**Aggregate functions does operations on fields or columns and Arithmetic functions does operation on rows or records.**
